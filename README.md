# Lab03-Word-Guess_Game

# Problem Domain
A client has requested a "word guessing game" be built. The idea of the game is a player must guess a randomly chosen mystery word by inputting one letter at a time. The game should save all guesses and fill in the mystery word on correct guesses. The work bank should be editable so a user can view, add, and delete game words.

# Directions
Clone the repository and open the project solution in VS. Run the program without debugging. The user can then select from the available selections on the console app screen. The game comes with default word bank. Select from the available options to view the word bank, add to the word bank, or remove from the word bank. Eventually, the play option will allow the user to play the guessing game. The game will randomly select a word from the word bank. Input one letter at a time. If the letter is correct, the _ will be replaced with the letter. Fill in all the letter to win the game.
